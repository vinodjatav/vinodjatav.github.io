  "In this project, I took a lead role in designing the blockchain-based key management system, integrating multiple innovative components. One of the standout features was the implementation of a secure key distribution protocol. Leveraging Hyperledger Fabric, I developed a modular architecture that allowed for scalable key management across various edge devices. I introduced a dynamic key rotation mechanism that automatically updates encryption keys based on predefined security policies, ensuring robust protection against unauthorized access. The integration of smart contracts facilitated automated approval processes for key issuance and revocation, significantly reducing administrative overhead and minimizing human error. I also created a user-friendly dashboard for real-time monitoring of key states and access logs, enhancing transparency and accountability in key management operations. By blending software and hardware solutions, my approach aimed to create a secure and efficient environment for edge security systems, paving the way for future innovations in key management.";
